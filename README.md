## Goals

- Use HTML5
- Use semantic HTML
- Make code as accessible as possible
- Remove deprecated attributes
- Use classes (optional: use scss)
- Modernize the design a little (firstly it should look like exactly the original site)
- Make it a bit more mobile responsive
- (optional) Refactor code to use React components (this should make the main index file a whole lot simpler)
